# A-message-for-the-future
Write a message to be engraved into the archive for the future.

## Introduction
GitHub have decided to [archive public repositories](https://archiveprogram.github.com/) for future generations. But as it is not just _programming code_ what powers this world, this repository has been created to let everyone write a message to the future.

## Using this repo
All messages belong to the subfolder "messages". There, each user may create a file (filename = username.md) and write their thoughts inside.
**Don't forget to make a pull-request after creating the file!**

## Markdown
Messages have **.md** extension. This allows users to use [Markdown features](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to add some style to messages.
